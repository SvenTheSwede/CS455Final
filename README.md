Linear regression model from sklearn is found in regression.py. The input stock is hardcoded so to change which stock the csv file name must be changed.
Autoregressive forcaster from skforecast is found in autoregressiveforecast.py. Similarly, the input stock is also hardcoded.
Aside from choosing which csv file to load, the files should run and compile display graphs and metrics when available. Each file is intended to function independently.
